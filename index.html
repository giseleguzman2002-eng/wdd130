            Hello, I'm Gisele and I'm 23 years old, I'm from Argentina, Buenos Aires. I like sunsets, especially
            those
            seen from the
            BS.As Temple and near my home. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
            for 6
            years, I
            like to dance, listen to music and watch series. Something I like about Buenos Aires is its wonderful
            history that it
            has in my personal life.</p>
