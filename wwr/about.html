            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Down the River has a rich history that dates back to the early 19th century. The sport
                originated in
                the United States, where explorers and adventurers would navigate the country's rivers in search
                of new
                lands and resources. The first recorded instance of down the river took place in 1811, when
                a group
                of fur traders used canoes to navigate the rapids of the Missouri River.
                In the early 20th century, white water rafting began to gain popularity as a recreational
                activity.The
                first commercial rafting trips were offered in the 1950s, and by the 1970s, the sport had become
                a
                popular way for outdoor enthusiasts to experience the thrill of navigating rapids and exploring
                remote
                wilderness areasToday, Down the River is enjoyed by millions of people around the world. It
